# Best Practices Learned
1. Always initialize stores with default values
2. Add protective checks around slot rendering for SSR compatibility
3. Leverage TypeScript for early error detection
4. Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
5. Ensure proper component integration with existing routing
6. Maintain synchronization between imports and routing logic

1. When implementing new feature requirements (like removing point caps), all related code needs to be audited
2. Debug logging helps verify the changes are working as expected

1. Always verify the actual event data structure through logging
2. Documentation may not always match implementation


1. Store user-facing information (like display names) alongside system IDs
2. Maintain consistency in how user information is displayed across different UI components
3. Update all related event handlers when modifying shared data structures

1. Maintain local form state separate from store state
2. Use initialLoad flag to prevent reactive overwrites
3. Ensure proper deep merging of nested config objects
4. Add comprehensive logging for debugging state issues
