# Streamer.bot WebSocket Integration - Architecture Brainstorm

## Overview

Implementing a WebSocket connection to Streamer.bot with connection status display, basic configuration, and Raw event logging in the debug console.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Centralized Store with WebSocket Service

**Architecture:**
- Create a dedicated WebSocket service class
- Use Svelte stores for connection state and messages
- Implement a connection manager component

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Centralized state management
- Easy to test and maintain
- Reusable WebSocket service

**Cons:**
- More initial setup required
- Slight overhead from store subscriptions

### 2. Component-Based with Context API

**Architecture:**
- WebSocket logic in a top-level component
- Use Svelte context for sharing connection
- Direct component communication

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation
- Less boilerplate code
- More direct component updates

**Cons:**
- Tighter coupling between components
- Less flexible for future extensions
- Harder to test isolated components

### 3. Event-Driven with Message Bus

**Architecture:**
- Event bus pattern for WebSocket events
- Decentralized handlers for different event types
- Pub/sub communication between components

**Pros:**
- Highly decoupled architecture
- Easy to add new event handlers
- Great for complex event flows
- Flexible for future features

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Potential message handling overhead
- May be overkill for current requirements
