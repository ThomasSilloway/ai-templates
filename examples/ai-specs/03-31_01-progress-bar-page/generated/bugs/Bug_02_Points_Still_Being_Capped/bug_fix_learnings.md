# Bug Fix Learnings

## What Worked
1. The issue was successfully resolved by removing the point capping logic:
   - Removed `Math.min()` calls that were artificially limiting points
   - Removed max attribute from input field
   - Added debug logging for better visibility of point changes

## Key Takeaways
1. When implementing new feature requirements (like removing point caps), all related code needs to be audited
2. Debug logging helps verify the changes are working as expected
3. Simple direct fixes (removing the cap) were more effective than complex solutions

## Future Prevention
1. When making fundamental system changes (like switching from capped to uncapped points), create a checklist of all places that might need updating
2. Consider adding automated tests to verify behavior changes
3. Use debug logging to maintain visibility of system behavior
