# Bug Fix Learnings

## What Worked
1. **Clear Bug Identification**
   - The bug was easily identified by comparing the default value in DebugPanel.svelte with the intended defaults in the progress store
   - The change history in change_notes.md helped confirm when and why the default value was changed to 500

2. **Simple Fix**
   - The fix only required changing a single line of code
   - No complex refactoring or architectural changes were needed
   - The fix aligned with existing system defaults in progress.ts

3. **Easy Verification**
   - The fix could be immediately verified by refreshing the page
   - The Debug Panel's UI made it clear whether the fix was successful

## Lessons Learned
1. **Code Review Practices**
   - When updating default values across a system, all related variables should be identified and updated
   - A systematic review of all files that use a particular value should be performed

2. **Documentation**
   - The change_notes.md was valuable in understanding the history of the change
   - Having well-documented changes helped identify when and why the default value was updated

3. **Testing**
   - Simple UI verification was sufficient for this bug
   - No additional logging was needed due to the straightforward nature of the fix

## Future Prevention
1. **Code Standardization**
   - Consider centralizing default values in the stores to prevent inconsistencies
   - Could use store values directly instead of local variable initialization where appropriate

2. **Review Process**
   - Add a checklist item for reviewing all related default values when making system-wide changes
   - Consider adding automated tests for default values in critical components
