## v05 - Point Capping Bug Fix

### Fixed DebugPanel Point Limit
- Removed point capping logic from addBeardPoints and addShavePoints functions
- Removed max attribute from test points input field
- Added debug logging for point update tracking
- Verified points now accumulate beyond 5000 as intended

### Technical Details
- Removed Math.min() calls that were artificially limiting points
- Updated input validation to maintain only minimum value of 0
- Added console logging to track point updates for debugging
- Confirmed proper integration with existing action history tracking

## v06 - Debug Panel Default Value Fix

### Fixed Default Test Points
- Updated default Test Points value in Debug Panel from 100 to 500
- Aligned Debug Panel's default with system-wide point defaults
- Verified correct default persists after page refresh

### Technical Details
- Modified initial value in DebugPanel.svelte
- Ensured consistency with point configuration defaults from progress store
- Confirmed proper initialization on component mount

## v07 - Point Configuration Implementation

### Added Settings UI
- Created PointConfigForm component for point configuration
- Added form sections for bits, subscriptions, and resub settings
