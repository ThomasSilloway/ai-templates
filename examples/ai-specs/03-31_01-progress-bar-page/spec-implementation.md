## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface (including Settings and Debug) powered by shared state management. Core functionality involves integrating with Streamer.bot via its WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab allows users to configure the connection (host, port, hidden arguments) and view the connection status. A Debug console displays formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding and truncation for long values. The app utilizes persistent stores for configuration and debug messages, and is containerized with Docker for development and deployment.

## Tasks

### Implement PRD
 - Implement the PRD, keeping in mind to limit files to 500 lines of code or less.

### Update change_notes.md file
 - If ./generated/change_notes.md file doesn't exist, create it inside the same directory as the prd
 - For each set of changes you implement, add a new section with:
  - ## Version title Ex: v01
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT - ONLY include the changes that have ALREADY been implemented in previous steps, not future plans
 - Always append new changes as a new section at the bottom of the file, keeping the previous change notes intact

### Double check your implementation
```
 - Make sure the PRD was implemented correctly
 - Append the notes of your review to change_notes.md
 - Ensure each file that was touched has an empty line at the end of the file
```
