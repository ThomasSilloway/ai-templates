# twitch-interactive-app

## High Level Overview
 We just implemented a new feature. I've provided the details of a bug that's occuring, please debug it using the steps below.

## Feature info

a dynamic progress bar to track "beard" versus "shave" points. The feature will include a main visual bar, a preview bar showing pending points, and smooth animations. Point configuration settings for different monetization methods (bits, subs, tiers) will be managed in a separate settings tab. A debug panel is required for monitoring values, testing point additions, and resetting progress. Development emphasizes modular components and keeping code files under 500 lines.
 
## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface (including Settings and Debug) powered by shared state management. Core functionality involves integrating with Streamer.bot via its WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab allows users to configure the connection (host, port, hidden arguments) and view the connection status. A Debug console displays formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding and truncation for long values. The app utilizes persistent stores for configuration and debug messages, and is containerized with Docker for development and deployment.

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks in order:

### Analyze related code files
```
 - READ Related code files
 - ANALYZE the code files to spot potential issues
 - ADD Logging to help observability of any issues - logs should be output to the DebugConsole in the app
 - ASK me to rerun the app so we can gather logs
 ```
