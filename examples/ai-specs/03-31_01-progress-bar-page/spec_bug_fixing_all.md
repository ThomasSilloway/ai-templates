# twitch-interactive-app

## High Level Overview
 We just implemented a new feature. We found a bug in the implementation. If more logging is needed, let's add more. If not, please fix the bug and I'll retry to see if it's fixed.

 Follow the steps below, starting with the first one and then choose the next task based off of the instructions. For each task, create a `new_task` to handle it for you using boomerang mode

## Bug Description

- the ` pointConfiguration (in Settings Tab)` in the PRD either isn't implemented or is broken. I'm not seeing any config values for these in the Settings tab.

## Feature info

a dynamic progress bar to track "beard" versus "shave" points. The feature will include a main visual bar, a preview bar showing pending points, and smooth animations. Point configuration settings for different monetization methods (bits, subs, tiers) will be managed in a separate settings tab. A debug panel is required for monitoring values, testing point additions, and resetting progress. Development emphasizes modular components and keeping code files under 500 lines.
 
## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface (including Settings and Debug) powered by shared state management. Core functionality involves integrating with Streamer.bot via its WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab allows users to configure the connection (host, port, hidden arguments) and view the connection status. A Debug console displays formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding and truncation for long values. The app utilizes persistent stores for configuration and debug messages, and is containerized with Docker for development and deployment.

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks in order:

### Create bug report
```
Record your notes about the bug in a new file inside generated\bugs\
- Located the generated\bugs folder in the same directory as the prd file
- Find the highest bug number folder in the generated\bugs folder
- Naming convention: Bug_<number + 1>_<Bug_Description>
- Note the bug description in the folder name should be 5 words or less
- Example: Bug_01_Signal_Connection_API_Incompatibility
- CREATE the new folder with that name in .\generated\bugs\
- Then write the bug description into a new file inside the folder called `bug_description.md`
- Do not write any possible solutions in the bug report, just details about the bug
- ASK ME to review the bug report before doing anything else
```

### Write Fix Bug Plan
```
- ASK me any questions about the bug or code files you might have before proceeding
- WRITE bug_fix_plan.md with the details of how to fix the bug. Use same directory as the `bug_description.md`
- ASK me to review the new document and provide feedback
```

### Fix the bug
```
- IMPLEMENT the bug_fix_plan.md plan
- ASK me to run the app again and check functionality
- After reading my feedback: 
 - CHOOSE the next task below, whichever seems more appropriate [Complete] or [Fix the Bug] or [Add more logging]
```

### Add more logging
```
 - READ Related logs
 - ANALYZE the code files and the logs to spot potential issues
 - ADD Logging to help observability of any issues - logs should be output to the DebugConsole in the app
 - ASK me to run the app again and gather the logs 
 ```

 ### Complete
 ```
 - WRITE bug_fix_learnings.md with the details of what worked, what didn't work from this process. Use same directory as the `bug_description.md`
 ```

 ### Update change_notes.md file
 - If ./generated/change_notes.md file doesn't exist, create it inside the same directory as the prd
 - For each set of changes you implement, add a new section with:
  - ## Version title Ex: v01
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT - ONLY include the changes that have ALREADY been implemented in previous steps, not future plans
 - Always append new changes as a new section at the bottom of the file, keeping the previous change notes intact
