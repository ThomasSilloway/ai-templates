Add support for twtich bits, subs, etc to affect the progress bar according to the design.
| Example: a twitch cheer for bits that includes 500 bits and the !beard command should add the appropriate number of points to the beard side and adjust the progress bar accordingly   
| Example 2: A twitch gift sub or any other type of event that makes the streamer money, but does not include the !beard or !shave command should add their points to the queue and when 
 they next execute the !beard or !shave command, it should apply those points to the progress bar system.
