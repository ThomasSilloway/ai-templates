# Bug Fix Learnings: Undefined Username in Sub Event

## Root Cause
- The Twitch.Sub event data structure was different than expected
- Username was nested under `data.user.name` not `data.username` or `data.userName`
- Initial implementation didn't account for the nested structure

## Solution Implemented
1. Updated TwitchSubData interface to correctly reflect the event structure:
```typescript
interface TwitchSubData {
  user: {
    id: string;
    name: string;  // Correct username field
    // ... other user fields
  };
  sub_tier: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

2. Modified StreamerbotService to use `data.user.name`:
```typescript
const username = data.user.name;
```

3. Added debug logging to verify the fix:
```typescript
this.addDebugMessage(`SUB EVENT DATA: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
```

## Key Takeaways
1. Always verify the actual event data structure through logging
2. Documentation may not always match implementation
3. Nested structures require careful field access
4. Debug logging is crucial for troubleshooting event data

## Verification
- Confirmed through logs that username now appears correctly
- Points are being assigned to the proper users
- Progress bar updates as expected for subscriptions
