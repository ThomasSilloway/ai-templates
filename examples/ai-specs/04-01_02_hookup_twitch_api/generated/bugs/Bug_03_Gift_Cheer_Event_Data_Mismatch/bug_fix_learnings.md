# Bug Fix Learnings

## Key Takeaways

1. Event data structure verification is crucial
- Actual event data often differs from expected/documented structure
- Full event data logging helps identify these mismatches
- Each event type needs careful validation of its data shape

2. TypeScript interfaces must match reality
- Update interfaces to match actual event data structure
- This prevents runtime errors and improves type safety
- Regular verification of event data shapes helps keep types accurate

## What Worked
- Using debug logging to verify actual event data structure
- Keeping type definitions in sync with actual data
- Making surgical fixes to event handlers without disrupting other functionality

## What Could Be Better
- More comprehensive event data structure documentation
- Regular validation of all event type definitions against actual data
- Adding runtime type checking as backup for TypeScript type assertions

## Future Prevention
1. Always add debug logging for full event data
2. Verify field access paths in handlers match actual data structure
3. Keep type definitions updated based on observed data patterns
4. Consider using runtime type validation for critical event data
