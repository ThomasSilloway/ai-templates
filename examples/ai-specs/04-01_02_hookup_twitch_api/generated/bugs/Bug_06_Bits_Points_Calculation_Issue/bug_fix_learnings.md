# Bug Fix Learnings: Bits Points Calculation Issue

## What Worked
1. Proper decimal point handling:
   - Removing Math.floor preserved fractional points
   - Using direct multiplication and division maintained precision
   - No rounding was needed, allowing natural accumulation of partial points

2. Enhanced debug logging:
   - Added detailed calculation logging to show exact formula
   - Makes it easy to verify points are being calculated correctly
   - Shows relationship between bits and points clearly

## Key Insights
1. Integer vs Decimal Precision:
   - The original Math.floor approach assumed points should always be whole numbers
   - Reality showed we needed fractional points for fair distribution
   - JavaScript's floating-point math naturally handles the decimals well

2. Order of Operations:
   - Multiply before divide to maintain precision
   - (bits * points_per_100) / 100 gives correct proportional results
   - No need for intermediate rounding or floor operations

3. Testing Considerations:
   - Important to test different ratio scenarios (1:1, 2:1, 1:2)
   - Small bit amounts (1-99) are critical test cases
   - Logging helps verify calculations are working as expected

## Best Practices Reinforced
1. Avoid premature rounding/truncation of values
2. Add detailed logging for numerical calculations
3. Consider all possible ratio cases when dealing with proportional values
4. Test edge cases (very small inputs) thoroughly
