# Bug Description: Command Action History Missing

## Summary
When users use the !shave or !beard command, the progress bar updates correctly but the action is not recorded in the Action History section of the Debug Panel.

## Expected Behavior
- When a user executes !shave or !beard command
- The command should appear in the Action History section
- The history entry should show:
  - Type of action (Command)
  - Points applied
  - Target (beard/shave)
  - Timestamp

## Current Behavior
- Commands update the progress bar correctly
- No entry is added to the Action History section
- The command execution is only visible in the debug messages

## Impact
- Users cannot see the history of command executions
- Makes debugging and verification of point applications more difficult
- Reduces transparency of system state changes

## Additional Context
- Debug console shows the command being received and processed
- Progress bar updates indicate the points system is working
- Issue appears specific to action history recording, not point calculation
