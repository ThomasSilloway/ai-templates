# Bug Fix Learnings

## What Worked
- Using TypeScript interfaces effectively caught missing parameters when updating method signatures
- Store restructuring to include display names alongside points made the UI more user-friendly
- Consistent use of display names across all Twitch events (bits, subs, gift bombs)

## Challenges
1. Different event types (bits/subs/gifts) stored user display names in different locations in their data structures
2. Had to modify multiple components and services to support the new display name requirement
3. Needed to ensure backward compatibility while updating the store structure

## Best Practices Identified
1. Store user-facing information (like display names) alongside system IDs
2. Maintain consistency in how user information is displayed across different UI components
3. Update all related event handlers when modifying shared data structures

## Future Considerations
1. Consider standardizing Twitch event data structures to make user information access more consistent
2. Add data validation to ensure display names are always available
3. Consider adding fallback display options when user information is incomplete

## Documentation Updates Needed
1. Document the new PendingPointsEntry interface in the store
2. Update API documentation to reflect new parameter requirements
3. Update debug console documentation to explain user display name features
