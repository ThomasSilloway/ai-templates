# Overview

  Let's plan out a new feature. I've included detailed info below.

  Follow each task below one by one, make sure not to skip any steps.

## Feature Overview

Add support for twtich bits, subs, etc to affect the progress bar according to the design.
| Example: a twitch cheer for bits that includes 500 bits and the !beard command should add the appropriate number of points to the beard side and adjust the progress bar accordingly   
| Example 2: A twitch gift sub or any other type of event that makes the streamer money, but does not include the !beard or !shave command should add their points to the queue and when 
 they next execute the !beard or !shave command, it should apply those points to the progress bar system.

## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab provides comprehensive configuration options, including connection settings (host, port, hidden arguments), point system configuration (bits, subscriptions, multipliers), and real-time connection status monitoring. The app's latest feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, all managed through reactive Svelte stores. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding, truncation for long values, and a dedicated panel for testing point interactions and previewing progress bar updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions.

- ASK me questions you might have about the feature overview that will help in figuring out how to implement it
- CREATE a brainstorm doc called ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\architecture_brainstorm.md 
- THINK about 3 different ways to implement the feature
- UPDATE doc with a short summary of each with pros and cons
- ASK me to review the doc and choose one
```
