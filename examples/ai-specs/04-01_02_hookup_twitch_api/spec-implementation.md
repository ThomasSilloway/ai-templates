## Feature info

Add support for twtich bits, subs, etc to affect the progress bar according to the design.
| Example: a twitch cheer for bits that includes 500 bits and the !beard command should add the appropriate number of points to the beard side and adjust the progress bar accordingly   
| Example 2: A twitch gift sub or any other type of event that makes the streamer money, but does not include the !beard or !shave command should add their points to the queue and when 
 they next execute the !beard or !shave command, it should apply those points to the progress bar system.

 
## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab provides comprehensive configuration options, including connection settings (host, port, hidden arguments), point system configuration (bits, subscriptions, multipliers), and real-time connection status monitoring. The app's latest feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, all managed through reactive Svelte stores. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding, truncation for long values, and a dedicated panel for testing point interactions and previewing progress bar updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions.

## Tasks

### Implement PRD
 - Implement the PRD, keeping in mind to limit files to 500 lines of code or less.

 ### Update change_notes.md file
- IMPORTANT: Always preserve existing content and append new changes
- First READ the current content of ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated/change_notes.md to determine the next version number
- Add a new section with:
  - Version title (increment from last version, e.g., if last was v03, use v04)
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT:
      - ONLY append new changes, DO NOT modify or delete existing content
      - ONLY include changes that have ALREADY been implemented, not future plans
      - Each new version should be added at the bottom of the file
      - Keep the same format as previous versions

### Double check your implementation
```
 - Make sure the PRD was implemented correctly
 - Append the notes of your review to change_notes.md
 - Ensure each file that was touched has an empty line at the end of the file
```
