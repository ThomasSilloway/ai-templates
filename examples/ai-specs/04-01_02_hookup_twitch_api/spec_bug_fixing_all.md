# twitch-interactive-app

## High Level Overview
 We just implemented a new feature. We found a bug in the implementation. If more logging is needed, let's add more. If not, please fix the bug and I'll retry to see if it's fixed.

 Follow the steps below, starting with the first one and then choose the next task based off of the instructions.

## Bug Description

Everything in the PRD is working as expected now except for this: 

When I use the !shave or !beard command, it updates the bar properly, but does not add that information to the `Action History` in the Debug Panel of the Progress Bar tab

## Feature info

Add support for twtich bits, subs, etc to affect the progress bar according to the design.
| Example: a twitch cheer for bits that includes 500 bits and the !beard command should add the appropriate number of points to the beard side and adjust the progress bar accordingly   
| Example 2: A twitch gift sub or any other type of event that makes the streamer money, but does not include the !beard or !shave command should add their points to the queue and when 
 they next execute the !beard or !shave command, it should apply those points to the progress bar system.

 
## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab provides comprehensive configuration options, including connection settings (host, port, hidden arguments), point system configuration (bits, subscriptions, multipliers), and real-time connection status monitoring. The app's latest feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, all managed through reactive Svelte stores. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding, truncation for long values, and a dedicated panel for testing point interactions and previewing progress bar updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions. 

## Generated Folder Path

Full path to generated folder: ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks in order:

### Create bug report
```
Record your notes about the bug in a new file inside ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated\bugs\ 
- Located the ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated\bugs folder in the same directory as the prd file
- Find the highest bug number folder in the ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated\bugs folder
- Naming convention: Bug_<number + 1>_<Bug_Description>
- Note the bug description in the folder name should be 5 words or less
- Example: Bug_01_Signal_Connection_API_Incompatibility
- CREATE the new folder with that name in ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated\bugs\
- Then write the bug description into a new file inside the folder called `bug_description.md`
- Do not write any possible solutions in the bug report, just details about the bug
- ASK ME to review the bug report before doing anything else
```

### Write Fix Bug Plan
```
- ASK me any questions about the bug or code files you might have before proceeding
- WRITE bug_fix_plan.md with the details of how to fix the bug. Use same directory as the `bug_description.md`
  - Use only pseudo code if its even necessary, do not write full code blocks
- ASK me to review the new document and provide feedback
```

### Fix the bug
```
- IMPLEMENT the bug_fix_plan.md plan
- ASK me to run the app again and check functionality
- After reading my feedback: 
 - CHOOSE the next task below, whichever seems more appropriate [Complete] or [Fix the Bug] or [Add more logging]
```

### Add more logging
```
 - READ Related logs
 - ANALYZE the code files and the logs to spot potential issues
 - ADD Logging to help observability of any issues - logs should be output to the DebugConsole in the app
 - ASK me to run the app again and gather the logs 
 ```

 ### Complete
 ```
 - WRITE bug_fix_learnings.md with the details of what worked, what didn't work from this process. Use same directory as the `bug_description.md`
 ```

 ### Update change_notes.md file
- IMPORTANT: Always preserve existing content and append new changes
- First READ the current content of ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated/change_notes.md to determine the next version number
- Add a new section with:
  - Version title (increment from last version, e.g., if last was v03, use v04)
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT:
      - ONLY append new changes, DO NOT modify or delete existing content
      - ONLY include changes that have ALREADY been implemented, not future plans
      - Each new version should be added at the bottom of the file
      - Keep the same format as previous versions
