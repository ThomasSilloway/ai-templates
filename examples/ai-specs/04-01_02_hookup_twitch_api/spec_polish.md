## High Level Overview
 We just implemented a new feature. There's a few things to tweak to add some polish

  Follow each task below one by one, make sure not to skip any steps. 

## Polish

- It doesn't seem like I can use Streamerbot to simulate the case where a person does a subscription with a message.  For example, they subscribe 1 month at tier 1 and include the command !beard  - In this case, the point should be added directly to the beard side instead of going through the queue.  I think we need to add some test logic in our code to be able to force these situations for testing.  Need to be able to do this for subs, resubs, and bits. I don't think the other ones have support for adding a message with them.

Make a new setting in the Settings Tab to configure what the message should be.  By default it should be empty string, but if we change it to !beard it should add that to the message.   This is a DEBUG setting only. Make a Debug Settings panel below Point Configuration, but above Hidden Arguments Configuratio.

## Feature info

Add support for twtich bits, subs, etc to affect the progress bar according to the design.
| Example: a twitch cheer for bits that includes 500 bits and the !beard command should add the appropriate number of points to the beard side and adjust the progress bar accordingly   
| Example 2: A twitch gift sub or any other type of event that makes the streamer money, but does not include the !beard or !shave command should add their points to the queue and when 
 they next execute the !beard or !shave command, it should apply those points to the progress bar system.

 
## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab provides comprehensive configuration options, including connection settings (host, port, hidden arguments), point system configuration (bits, subscriptions, multipliers), and real-time connection status monitoring. The app's latest feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, all managed through reactive Svelte stores. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding, truncation for long values, and a dedicated panel for testing point interactions and previewing progress bar updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions.

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks in order:

### Create polish plans
```
Record your notes about each polish item in a new file inside ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated\polish\ 
- Find the highest number folder in the ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated
- Naming convention: Polish_<number + 1>_<Polish_Description>
- Note the Polish description in the folder name should be 5 words or less
- Example: Polish_01_Improve_Timestamp_Formatting
- CREATE the new folder with that name in ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated\polish\
- Then write the polish description into a new file inside the folder called `polish_description.md`
- Write 3 possible solutions for how to implement this small change to the feature
- ASK ME to review the polish reports before doing anything else
```

### Implement the changes for each polish item one by one
```
- IMPLEMENT the polish_description.md plan with the accepted solution
- ASK me to run the app again and check functionality
```

 ### Update change_notes.md file
- IMPORTANT: Always preserve existing content and append new changes
- First READ the current content of ai-specs\04-01_02_hookup_twitch_api\generated/change_notes.md to determine the next version number
- Add a new section with:
  - Version title (increment from last version, e.g., if last was v03, use v04)
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT:
      - ONLY append new changes, DO NOT modify or delete existing content
      - ONLY include changes that have ALREADY been implemented, not future plans
      - Each new version should be added at the bottom of the file
      - Keep the same format as previous versions
