# twitch-interactive-app

## High Level Overview
 We just implemented a new feature. We found a bug in the implementation. If more logging is needed, let's add more. If not, please fix the bug and I'll retry to see if it's fixed.

 Follow the steps below, starting with the first one and then choose the next task based off of the instructions.

## Feature info

We are currently doing the cheer/bit detection incorrectly. The current way is missing some of the "Power Ups" like giantify. So instead of the curreent way, we need to refactor it to use the `ChatMessage` event from the websocket. I've put the relevant API info below

## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for comprehensive event handling of Twitch monetary events (bits, subscriptions, gift subs) and commands. The Settings tab provides extensive configuration options, including connection settings, point system configuration with support for various ratio scenarios, and real-time connection status monitoring, while a new Debug Settings panel enables test message configuration for subscription events. The app's core feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, now enhanced with automatic point allocation from Twitch events and a queuing system for pending points. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions with color-coding, a dedicated point testing panel, and a new pending points display that shows queued points per user with real-time updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions while maintaining type-safe event handling throughout the system.

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks in order:

### Create bug report
```
Record your notes about the bug in a new file inside ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated\bugs\ 
- Located the ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated\bugs folder in the same directory as the prd file
- Find the highest bug number folder in the ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated\bugs folder
- Naming convention: Bug_<number + 1>_<Bug_Description>
- Note the bug description in the folder name should be 5 words or less
- Example: Bug_01_Signal_Connection_API_Incompatibility
- CREATE the new folder with that name in ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated\bugs\
- Then write the bug description into a new file inside the folder called `bug_description.md`
- Do not write any possible solutions in the bug report, just details about the bug
- ASK ME to review the bug report before doing anything else
```

### Write Fix Bug Plan
```
- ASK me any questions about the bug or code files you might have before proceeding
- WRITE bug_fix_plan.md with the details of how to fix the bug. Use same directory as the `bug_description.md`
  - Use only pseudo code if its even necessary, do not write full code blocks
- ASK me to review the new document and provide feedback
```

### Fix the bug
```
- IMPLEMENT the bug_fix_plan.md plan
- ASK me to run the app again and check functionality
- After reading my feedback: 
 - CHOOSE the next task below, whichever seems more appropriate [Complete] or [Fix the Bug] or [Add more logging]
```

### Add more logging
```
 - READ Related logs
 - ANALYZE the code files and the logs to spot potential issues
 - ADD Logging to help observability of any issues - logs should be output to the DebugConsole in the app
 - ASK me to run the app again and gather the logs 
 ```

 ### Complete
 ```
 - WRITE bug_fix_learnings.md with the details of what worked, what didn't work from this process. Use same directory as the `bug_description.md`
 ```

### Update change_notes.md file
- IMPORTANT: Always preserve existing content and append new changes
- First READ the current content of ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated/change_notes.md to determine the next version number
- Add a new section with:
  - Version title (increment from last version, e.g., if last was v03, use v04)
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT:
      - ONLY append new changes, DO NOT modify or delete existing content
      - ONLY include changes that have ALREADY been implemented, not future plans
      - Each new version should be added at the bottom of the file
      - Keep the same format as previous versions
