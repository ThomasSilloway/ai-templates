## Feature info

We are currently doing the cheer/bit detection incorrectly. The current way is missing some of the "Power Ups" like giantify. So instead of the curreent way, we need to refactor it to use the `ChatMessage` event from the websocket. I've put the relevant API info below

## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for comprehensive event handling of Twitch monetary events (bits, subscriptions, gift subs) and commands. The Settings tab provides extensive configuration options, including connection settings, point system configuration with support for various ratio scenarios, and real-time connection status monitoring, while a new Debug Settings panel enables test message configuration for subscription events. The app's core feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, now enhanced with automatic point allocation from Twitch events and a queuing system for pending points. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions with color-coding, a dedicated point testing panel, and a new pending points display that shows queued points per user with real-time updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions while maintaining type-safe event handling throughout the system.

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks in order:

### Create polish plans
```
Record your notes about each polish item in a new file inside ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated\polish\ 
- Find the highest number folder in the ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated
- Naming convention: Polish_<number + 1>_<Polish_Description>
- Note the Polish description in the folder name should be 5 words or less
- Example: Polish_01_Improve_Timestamp_Formatting
- CREATE the new folder with that name in ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated\polish\
- Then write the polish description into a new file inside the folder called `polish_description.md`
- Write 3 possible solutions for how to implement this small change to the feature
- ASK ME to review the polish reports before doing anything else
```

### Implement the changes for each polish item one by one
```
- IMPLEMENT the polish_description.md plan with the accepted solution
- ASK me to run the app again and check functionality
```

### Update change_notes.md file
- IMPORTANT: Always preserve existing content and append new changes
- First READ the current content of ai-specs\04-04_01_gigantify-powerups\generated/change_notes.md to determine the next version number
- Add a new section with:
  - Version title (increment from last version, e.g., if last was v03, use v04)
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT:
      - ONLY append new changes, DO NOT modify or delete existing content
      - ONLY include changes that have ALREADY been implemented, not future plans
      - Each new version should be added at the bottom of the file
      - Keep the same format as previous versions
