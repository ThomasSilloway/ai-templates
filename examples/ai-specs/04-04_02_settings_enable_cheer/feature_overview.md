We need to add a debug settings to the SettingsPanel under the `Debug Settings` header. It should be a checkbox for if the Cheer websocket event should be subscribed to or not. Toggling it off should unsubscribe, toggling it on should subscribe. Each of those should show a message in the DebugConsole tab for the current status and confirm the toggle worked.  You should not have to disconnect and reconnect to get this toggling.  However, it should save the setting, so next time you run the app it should know to subscribe or not based off that setting.
