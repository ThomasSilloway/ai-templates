# Bug Fix Learnings

## Initial Issues
1. Checkbox state was not updating due to reactive statement overwriting local state
2. Config changes were not persisting between page refreshes

## Resolution Process
1. Added diagnostic logging to track:
   - Form state changes
   - Store updates
   - Config persistence

2. Fixed checkbox functionality by:
   - Implementing local state management
   - Adding initialLoad flag
   - Updating checkbox binding

3. Fixed persistence by:
   - Adding proper localStorage handling
   - Implementing deep merge for config updates
   - Adding debug logging for persistence operations

## Key Takeaways
1. Maintain local form state separate from store state
2. Use initialLoad flag to prevent reactive overwrites
3. Ensure proper deep merging of nested config objects
4. Add comprehensive logging for debugging state issues

## Testing Approach
1. Test checkbox toggle functionality
2. Verify save button state
3. Test persistence across page refreshes
4. Monitor debug console for state changes

## Final Resolution
1. WebSocket Event Handler Management:
   - Event handlers need explicit cleanup when unsubscribing
   - Handlers should be synchronized with subscription state
   - Separate subscription logic from handler management

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Verify both subscription and handler states
   - Test persistence across page refreshes
   - Monitor WebSocket events in addition to UI state
