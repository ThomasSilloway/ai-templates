We need a new setting added to `Debug Settings` section of the Settings tab called `Enable Debug: API` -  When this is toggled on, the event data logs that we already have (some commented in, some commented out) will be enabled.  When the setting is toggled off, these logs will no longer display.  The logs are currently outputting to the DebugConsole which is great and want to maintain that.
