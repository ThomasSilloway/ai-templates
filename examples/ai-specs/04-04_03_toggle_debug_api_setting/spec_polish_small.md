## High Level Overview
 We just implemented a new feature. There's a few things to tweak to add some polish

  Follow each task below one by one, make sure not to skip any steps.

  When creating subtasks with boomerang mode, make sure to include enough context including the filepaths to any files to be modified, filepaths to design docs, etc

## Polish

- Allow the multiplier settings in `Point Configuration` be able to go to 3 digits, right now they are restricted to 1 digit.  IE right now can only do 2.5 or 2.6 but want to be able to do 2.512

- Update the display of `Action History` and `Pending Points` to display the points rounded to the nearest hundreth of a number (ex. 500.05 is fine, but 500.000000002 is not okay). Right now there's some weird floating point number issues where it can show 200.000000005 for example depending on what the multiplier is.  If the number is an int and has no decimals, it should display no decimals by default.

## Feature info

We need a new setting added to `Debug Settings` section of the Settings tab called `Enable Debug: API` -  When this is toggled on, the event data logs that we already have (some commented in, some commented out) will be enabled.  When the setting is toggled off, these logs will no longer display.  The logs are currently outputting to the DebugConsole which is great and want to maintain that.

 
## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for comprehensive event handling of Twitch monetary events (bits, subscriptions, gift subs) and commands. The Settings tab provides extensive configuration options, including connection settings, point system configuration with support for various ratio scenarios, and real-time connection status monitoring. The Debug Settings panel now includes an "Enable Cheer Event" checkbox, allowing dynamic WebSocket event subscription management with persistent configuration. The app's core feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, now enhanced with automatic point allocation from Twitch events and a queuing system for pending points. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions with color-coding, subscription status messages, a dedicated point testing panel, and a new pending points display that shows queued points per user with real-time updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions while maintaining type-safe event handling throughout the system.

## Tasks
Perform the following tasks in order:

### Ask me questions
```
- ASK me questions about each polish item to make sure you understand the requirements
```

### Implement the changes for each polish item one by one
```
- IMPLEMENT the change
- ASK me to run the app again and check functionality
```

### Update change_notes.md file
- IMPORTANT: Always preserve existing content and append new changes
- First READ the current content of ai-specs\04-04_03_toggle_debug_api_setting\generated/change_notes.md to determine the next version number
- Add a new section with:
  - Version title (increment from last version, e.g., if last was v03, use v04)
    - A brief description of the changes made already made, IMPORTANT: not planned changes
    - Details of what was already implemented/fixed
    - IMPORTANT:
      - ONLY append new changes, DO NOT modify or delete existing content
      - ONLY include changes that have ALREADY been implemented, not future plans
      - Each new version should be added at the bottom of the file
      - Keep the same format as previous versions
