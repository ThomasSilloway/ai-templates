# Architecture Brainstorm: Remove Pending Points Feature

This document explores different approaches for implementing the feature to remove pending points from the `DebugPanel`.

## Feature Requirements Summary

*   Add an (x) icon (color: `#aaaaaa`) next to each user entry in the "Pending Points" list within `DebugPanel.svelte`.
*   Clicking the (x) icon immediately removes that user's pending points from the `userPendingPoints` store.
*   Add a "Clear All" button, right-aligned next to the "Pending Points" `<h4>` heading.
*   Clicking the "Clear All" button immediately removes all entries from the `userPendingPoints` store.
*   The list display updates instantly upon removal.
*   Log removal actions (both individual and clear all) to the Debug Console (`messages` store).

## Implementation Options

Here are three potential ways to implement this feature:

### Option 1: Direct Store Manipulation in Component (`DebugPanel.svelte`)

*   **Summary:** Add click event handlers directly to the new (x) icons and the "Clear All" button within `DebugPanel.svelte`. These handlers would directly call `userPendingPoints.update()` to modify the store (removing a specific key or setting it to an empty object `{}`). The handlers would also be responsible for calling `messages.addMessage()` to log the action.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Simple and straightforward implementation.
    *   Changes are localized entirely within the `DebugPanel.svelte` component.
    *   No modifications needed for existing services or store definitions.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Places state mutation logic and logging directly within the UI component, which slightly mixes concerns.
    *   If similar logic were needed elsewhere, it would require duplication.

### Option 2: New Methods in `PointManager` Service

*   **Summary:** Add two new methods to the existing `PointManager` service (in `src/lib/services/PointManager.ts`):
    *   `removePendingPointsForUser(userId: string, displayName: string)`: This method would handle removing the specific user entry from the `userPendingPoints` store and logging the removal via `messages.addMessage()`.
    *   `clearAllPendingPoints()`: This method would handle clearing the entire `userPendingPoints` store and logging the action.
    *   The click handlers in `DebugPanel.svelte` would then import the `PointManager` instance and call these new methods.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Keeps business logic (state mutation, logging) centralized within the relevant service (`PointManager`), improving separation of concerns.
    *   Leverages the existing service responsible for point management.
    *   Logic is potentially reusable if needed elsewhere.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires modifying the `PointManager` service, slightly increasing its responsibilities.
    *   Adds a layer of indirection compared to direct manipulation.

### Option 3: Dedicated Methods on a Custom Store

*   **Summary:** Convert the `userPendingPoints` store (currently a simple `writable` in `src/lib/stores/progress.ts`) into a custom Svelte store. This custom store would expose methods like `removeUser(userId: string)` and `clearAll()`. These methods would contain the logic to update the store's internal value. Logging could potentially be included here or handled separately. The click handlers in `DebugPanel.svelte` would call these methods directly on the store instance (e.g., `$userPendingPoints.removeUser(userId)`).
*   **Pros:**
    *   Encapsulates the store's mutation logic directly within the store definition itself.
    *   Provides a clean API for interacting with the store from components.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Increases the complexity of the `userPendingPoints` store definition, moving it from a simple `writable` to a custom store object.
    *   Including logging within the store methods might feel like mixing concerns, depending on the preferred architectural style.

## Recommendation

**Option 2 (New Methods in `PointManager` Service)** is recommended. It strikes a good balance between separation of concerns and implementation complexity. It leverages the existing `PointManager` service, which is already responsible for managing point logic and interacting with related stores (`totalBeardPoints`, `totalShavePoints`, `userPendingPoints`, `messages`, `actionHistory`). This keeps the component cleaner and the logic centralized without needing to introduce a more complex custom store structure for `userPendingPoints`.
