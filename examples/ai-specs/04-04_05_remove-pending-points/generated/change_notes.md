# Change Notes

## v01

### Implement Pending Points Removal Feature

Added functionality to remove individual pending points and clear all pending points via the DebugPanel:

* Added new methods to PointManager.ts:
  * `removePendingPointsForUser`: Removes specific pending points for a user
  * `clearAllPendingPoints`: Removes all pending points from the system

* Enhanced DebugPanel.svelte UI:
  * Added 'x' icon buttons next to individual pending point entries for selective removal
  * Added "Clear All" button in the "Pending Points" header section for bulk removal
  * Connected UI elements to the corresponding PointManager methods
  * Implemented debug logging for removal actions in the Debug Console

These changes provide more granular control over pending points management through the debug interface.

### Review Notes
- Verified implementation against PRD Section 4 (Technical Implementation).
- Confirmed PointManager.ts methods (`removePendingPointsForUser`, `clearAllPendingPoints`) are implemented correctly with proper store updates and logging.
- Confirmed DebugPanel.svelte UI elements ('x' icon with #aaaaaa color, 'Clear All' button with right-alignment) are present and correctly linked to PointManager methods.
- Confirmed all logging is handled via `logPointCalculation`.
- Ensured both modified files end with a newline character.

### Style Updates
- Updated button colors for a more subdued appearance:
  * Changed "Clear All" button background from `#757575` to `#555555` (darker grey)
  * Changed 'x' icon color from `#aaaaaa` to `#888888` (less prominent)
  * Added explicit white text color to "Clear All" button for better contrast
  * Fixed styling issues with `!important` rules to prevent red background inheritance
  * Made both buttons use normal font weight instead of bold
