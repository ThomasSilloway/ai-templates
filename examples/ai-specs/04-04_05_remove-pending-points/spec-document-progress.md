# Overview

  Some work on this new feature has already begun, let's document the progress thus far into /ai-docs/changelog/<number>-app-updates.md

  Follow each task below one by one, make sure not to skip any steps.

## Feature Overview

Next to each entry in the `Progress Bar` tab's `DebugPanel` that has `Pending Points` we need to have an (x) icon that can be clicked to remove those pending points in case there is a mistake.

We should also add a button next to the label `Pending Points` to clear the entire list.

The icon should be grey in color so it stands out from the dark grey background, but doesn't pop out like a bright red one would

## Project Details

This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for comprehensive event handling of Twitch monetary events (bits, subscriptions, gift subs - now with accurate point calculation for cumulative counts and duration months) and commands. The Settings tab provides extensive configuration options, including connection settings, point system configuration with support for various ratio scenarios (now with increased precision for multipliers), and real-time connection status monitoring. The Debug Settings panel includes controls like "Enable Cheer Event" and "Enable Debug: API", allowing dynamic WebSocket event subscription and logging management with persistent configuration. The app's core feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, now enhanced with automatic point allocation from Twitch events and a queuing system for pending points. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities (now with dynamic height and smart auto-scrolling), displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions with color-coding, subscription status messages, consistently formatted point values using a shared utility, a dedicated point testing panel, and a new pending points display that shows queued points per user with real-time updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions while maintaining type-safe event handling throughout the system.
