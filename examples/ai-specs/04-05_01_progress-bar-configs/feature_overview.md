Create a new Tab on the main page called Configs after the Settings, but before the DebugConsole
This new page should allows you to create, delete, modify configurations. Each configuration is used for a progress bar display on another page. You should be able to configure the text on each side of the progress bar (ex: Left, Right). The color of each side of the progress bar with a color picker that you can expand. Also need to be able to configure the configuration name. So one might be Beard/Shave and the other might be BeardType for example
