# Bug Fix Learnings: Stuck on Settings Page (Bug_01)

**Issue:**
The application UI was not updating when different navigation tabs were clicked; it remained stuck displaying the Settings page content.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The investigation pointed towards an inconsistency or error in the conditional rendering logic responsible for displaying tab content based on the `activeTab` store. While the initial hypothesis focused on `+layout.svelte`, the fix involved ensuring the conditional logic in `+page.svelte` correctly handled all tab states ('progress', 'settings', 'configs', 'debug') and matched the order/logic used in the navigation elements within `+layout.svelte`.

Additionally, a related issue arose during debugging due to the `svelte-color-picker` dependency not being installed. This was resolved by creating a basic local `ColorPicker.svelte` component as a placeholder/replacement.

**Fix:**
1.  Reviewed and corrected the `{#if $activeTab ...}` conditional rendering block in `src/routes/+page.svelte` to ensure it correctly mapped each possible value of the `$activeTab` store ('progress', 'settings', 'configs', 'debug') to the corresponding component (`ProgressBarContainer`, `SettingsTab`, `ConfigsTab`, `DebugConsole`).
2.  Created a local `ColorPicker.svelte` component (`src/lib/components/ColorPicker.svelte`) to satisfy the import in `ConfigsTab.svelte` and prevent build errors.
3.  Updated `ConfigsTab.svelte` to import the local `ColorPicker` component.

**Key Learnings:**
*   **Conditional Rendering Consistency:** When using a store (`activeTab`) to control conditional rendering across different components (like `+layout.svelte` for navigation and `+page.svelte` for content), ensure the logic (`{#if ... else if ...}`) is consistent and correctly handles all possible states in *both* locations if they share responsibility.
*   **Dependency Management:** Ensure all required external dependencies (like `svelte-color-picker`) are installed or provide local fallbacks/implementations if installation is not feasible during development/debugging. Build errors related to missing modules can sometimes mask underlying logic bugs.
*   **Debugging Steps:** Adding temporary console logs to track store changes (`handleTabClick`, reactive `$: log`) and carefully inspecting the conditional rendering blocks (`{#if...}`) proved effective in pinpointing the logic error.
