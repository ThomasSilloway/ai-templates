# Twitch App Prototype - Current State Summary

The Twitch App Prototype is a SvelteKit-based application featuring a three-tab interface (Progress Bar, Settings, and Debug) with seamless tab switching powered by a shared state management system. The Debug console implements a sophisticated color-coding system that visually distinguishes between different types of Twitch events (subscriptions in green, bits in purple, and general messages in gray) to enhance readability and event tracking. The app utilizes a persistent message store that maintains debug messages across tab switches, preparing for future integration with Streamer.bot's websocket API. The development environment is containerized using Docker, with separate configurations for development (with hot-reload) and production, making it easy to develop and deploy across different environments.
