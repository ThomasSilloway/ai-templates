This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface (including Settings and Debug) powered by shared state management. Core functionality involves integrating with Streamer.bot via its WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab allows users to configure the connection (host, port, hidden arguments) and view the connection status. A Debug console displays formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding and truncation for long values. The app utilizes persistent stores for configuration and debug messages, and is containerized with Docker for development and deployment.
