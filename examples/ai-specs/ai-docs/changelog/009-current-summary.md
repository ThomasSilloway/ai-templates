This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for event handling. The Settings tab provides comprehensive configuration options, including connection settings (host, port, hidden arguments), point system configuration (bits, subscriptions, multipliers), and real-time connection status monitoring. The app's latest feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, all managed through reactive Svelte stores. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities, displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions/sub-actions with color-coding, truncation for long values, and a dedicated panel for testing point interactions and previewing progress bar updates. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions.
