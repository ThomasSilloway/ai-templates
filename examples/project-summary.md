This SvelteKit-based Twitch app prototype features a multi-tab interface with shared state management, integrating with Streamer.bot via WebSocket SDK for comprehensive event handling of Twitch monetary events (bits, subscriptions, gift subs - now with accurate point calculation for cumulative counts and duration months) and commands, and includes initial scaffolding for Fourth Wall events (Donation, Gift Purchase, Order Placed) via a dedicated service (`FourthWallService`) that logs raw event data. The Settings tab provides extensive configuration options, including connection settings, point system configuration with support for various ratio scenarios (now with increased precision for multipliers), new settings for Fourth Wall event points, and real-time connection status monitoring. The Debug Settings panel includes controls like "Enable Cheer Event" and "Enable Debug: API", allowing dynamic WebSocket event subscription and logging management with persistent configuration. The app's core feature is an interactive progress bar system that tracks beard and shave points with smooth animations, configurable totals, and a 50/50 starting position, now enhanced with automatic point allocation from Twitch events and a queuing system for pending points. A Debug console offers extensive monitoring capabilities (now with dynamic height and smart auto-scrolling), displaying formatted Streamer.bot actions with color-coding, subscription status messages, consistently formatted point values using a shared utility, a dedicated point testing panel, and a new pending points display that shows queued points per user with real-time updates and includes controls to remove individual entries or clear the entire list. The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent development and deployment, utilizing persistent stores for configuration, debug messages, and point tracking, ensuring state preservation across sessions while maintaining type-safe event handling throughout the system.
